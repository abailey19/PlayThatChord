# Play That Chord

## The App
The Play That Chord app simulates one octave of a piano keyboard. The 12 keys are displayed horizontally on the screen and make the correct sounds when the user presses them. Play That Chord is a game to practice music theory. The game prompts users to enter four notes (the root, third, fifth, and seventh) of a given chord, tells them whether they are correct or not, and keeps a score of how many chords the user gets right. The game ends after two minutes, or once the user makes three mistakes. The user also has the option to simply play the piano keyboard without playing the game. 

## Some Issues
I created this Android app at the end of a two-week long beginner Java workshop the summer before my senior year of high school. When I opened it again this week, it was (unsurprisingly) incompatible with the version of Android studio I am currently running. I have had trouble updating the app correctly in order to get it to build. As such, I have just submitted my main Java and XML code without any of the gradle scripts. In the future, I hope to make these updates to get the app working again.
